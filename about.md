# About me

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." â€“ Richard Feynman

Driven by the passion for science and technology - skeptic and critical thinker - keen on tinkering, breaking and creating - a believer in the Church of GNU and Software Freedom - avid Sci-Fi fan and gamer by heart.

Currently working as a machine learning engineer at [Kepler Lab](http://experiencesutra.com/), research & development wing of SapientRazorfish_, India. My work at Kepler involves problem-solving using machine learning, researching and building deep learning models, and cracking occasional out-of-context jokes.

The prospect of AI fascinates me. I wish to see general artificial intelligence become a reality and hope to be one of the architects of the future of AI. I also have an OCD for symmetry.
