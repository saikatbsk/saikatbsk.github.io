# About me

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand." â€“ Richard Feynman

Driven by the passion for science and technology. Keen in tinkering,
breaking and creating. Resourceful, willing to make mistakes and learn.
Believer of the Church of GNU and Software Freedom. Avid Sci-Fi fan
and gamer by heart.

I describe myself as a skeptic. I believe in reason and critical thinking.

The prospect of Artificial Intelligence fascinates me. I wish to see
general artificial intelligence become a reality and hope to be one of
the architects of the future of AI. I also have an OCD for symmetry.
